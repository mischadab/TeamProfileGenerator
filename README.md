  ## Description
  This project is a Team Profile Generator. As a manager, when prompted, it asks for name, id, email and office number. Then it prompts you asking which employee to generate next. When selecting engineer, it asks for name, id, email and github. When selecting intern, it asks for name, id, email and school. Once you are completed and select "I am finished", an HTML file is generated with your employees and their info in it.
